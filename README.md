# DANYAL_451346_._AI_PROJECT
This Python code implements a simple Snake Game using the tkinter library. The game consists of two snakes - one operated by the user and the other by an AI using the A* algorithm. The objective is for both snakes to compete for 60 seconds, and the winner is determined by the length of the snakes at the end of the time limit.
